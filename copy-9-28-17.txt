for katy perry, 32 passionate copies of herself were mercilessly aware of their own passing. It was hurtful and she understands so much. The rumor is, she just really thought she would be a master of her most notorious secrets, but it was never approved by the twitterverse, and it appears to be falling flat. We will probably not be there for the 411 on that, but i love you.

communist manifesto as text:
A class is not the interests it has: it is only the conditions by which it was bound to be. 

Bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly bourgeois and proletarians cannot be exploded by small peasant proprietors.

All countries unite to abolish this spectre pope. 

The modern working class alone, being the most radical class, can no longer be swept into two birds. Two birds and one hand can ossify all children. 

The communists, therefore, disdain two things: 
I. The working hours that increase capital's money. 
II. The old feudal system of wives that have no need of a man's ideas

Gregor was a doctor and he always intended to be. He would often spend the whole evening looking at his father's arm. Gregor's mother would tug at the table, but he never responded. Indeed, the amount of time became highly uncomfortable. 

Gregor locked everyone in his room at first. His sister would sometimes ask for help, but then bulging occurred in her blouse, and Gregor hissed in anger. 

After a while, numb Gregor could see what he had done. He had completely forgotten that he was a lieutenant in the army, and he hurried back to the kitchen. As soon as he touched the door, Gregor nodded. His father, standing there in his way, now totally covered in white sauce, could see the five years that Gregor had taken away from his family. 

Gregor slowly moved forward towards his father, who seemed to count backwards. The gentlemen stepped into the room and pressed against Gregor. He was amazed at the enormous size of the three gentlemen. They decided to lift him and finally managed to get him to the window. Gregor listened as his sister began to cry. 

The family seemed to be quite alright with the idea that Gregor would not be noticed outside. They carried out the contract, and he was no more.

Here's my blocked magnum opus (and sorry for creating so much hassle):  Guinea pigs have cases of a spontaneous rapid white substance and sound especially young.  The most common varieties are not native. 
Guinea pigs learn complex paths to food pellets and plot with other rodents. Wild guinea pigs have shown some habits such as respiratory infections. Other breeds may require much less paper. This is not healthy for research. 
Of the inbred strains that have respiratory gas, many varieties are referred to as "popcorning". They startle extremely easily. Also they are usually allergic to hamsters. 
The domestic guinea pig is considered harmful for consumption.

A story from the Moth Podcast: 
my grandmother was a perfectionist. Thinking about her building  surgery school s above the first grade school, really beautiful hotels and me. 
But my mother told the children the first thing that would take my crutches; grandma hall didn't really know what her head did. 

All of us slept on mattresses, Like a religion. We were the finger and she was the culprit. She would make these white electricity side road s and we could see now how nice the car goes. 

I remember being loved but I still felt obligated to be exciting. Manhood had been jolly to me – someone that was wanted, when she turned round she said " something called daniel. " 
innocence didn't get there as it she ended mother s uncle. 

Grandma Grandma Grandmother soul - all musical instruments went to paris but Grandma stayed calm. Seeing me in the doorway made my mom's parents child know that they were abandoning me. 

You know what happened. Guilty that i was okay i did things to my grandma, spontaneous weed skiing, " important one rules " and discipline mule carts. 100 percent power - old mother came from the government. She perjured herself with all of these a accusations, people screaming " you need mom" and " discipline our husband s. "

nine day s happened. Well, like my brother says, " crash's happened behind a family. "

At the courthouse grandmother's book about construction company laws grabbed the states. Black gloves went around to where my mother was, i got myself going enough to decide that i could talk. 

" thief from building with blue polyester " "thief from building with blue polyester " "thief from building with blue polyester " I shouted. 

"How could you lie to us galesburg? " said the judge.  "i learned how sad all those young men were," and behind everybody grew a sudden pause.  

I guilty, I feel g guilty,  i feel kinda impressed by this enormous staff, i got involved with grandmother's construction and then reached over and rushed the jury. 

Grandma grabbed my shoulder -  " no, galesburg, you end your dick, i got myself this because i wanted something like prison. "

innocence did talk to me - just let it unfold -  old self, round self, favorite self.  Say it: " my grandmother's a combination of my mother and my dad. " 

abandoning that life would be making tortillas positive. And i know what i learned: be nice to good person 

Thank you.

Your partner is inattentive, be sure you can take advantage of it. Balance your sense of joy with doing things.  Artistic admiration is feeling a lot less productive but people are protesting snacks instead of trying to paint intuitive impressions. Dinner your jobs regardless.

You might discover some figment of your imagination worked hard to connect with your partner tonight. Note this could be thrilling, but this is what you need to worry about. Give them the room to get caught in the evening. Let your imagination take care of your body. Panic until tomorrow. Seize some of the mountain love your snuggling needs to make sure your partner longs for negative situations. The planetary energies respond in a great emotional climax in the future. Your plans may be going smoothly, but information could prove unexpectedly to make decisions feel different. Friends bring life to the heart. Your intuition isn't worth it. Perhaps a poem?

the prince had caused a product backlog, once more. Bitterly he finished sewing, and was lamenting over it, then -- there was nothing else to be done. A troll came who had nine development teams, and the prince ran to embrace them. Then he took out his bag of blue constraints, and all the people gazed in silent wonder. The product owner and the little mouse danced before the prince, who was so delighted that he said: ' all the fairies who designed you will be able to kill you!' 
this will only be funny to people in a very specific industry, but i had to try it

The little captain, the universe I press my fingers across, is erect and brawny 
Speak to me as a horse, and I will show what festoons my house
Youth! Your milky stream is a miracle in my face

Veil'd woman of earth, you conceive nothing but unflagging pregnancy! 
O unspeakable old deform'd wife, you must not know that I love him

and i been working
and i been drunk in my eyes
and i been baptized on

To you, 

although you may be wondering why i contacted you after london, i do appreciate mr office making this generous file. Please exercise also have health. Fifty thousand great family members will fight me and defile me. Intentions of the widows of email are not the good. 

Deeds i do. I await nothing - arrangements with the international shipping company insisted that the house husband died. 

Please assure me that you will act accordingly. 

Receiving this letter will be used as a joke - cancer for me, thirty five hundred thousand british railway letters for you. 

Do send me everything Boris, your country, relatives, internet, everything......................... Bless you because i need your Telephone.

Hey Todd, 

If you dumped each passing day because you're embarrassed about nonpenetrative stories regarding his legally recognized ex girlfriend, give him six years of creepiness. 
Frequently — suggest games that excuse the honest exchange of shirts. Justify it using something contaminated to get smitten tongue swapping pics. 

Gay people boned, fucked, and served their lives for slap introductions. 

I vomit technically - the motherfucker mugs don't have feelings but your boyfriend is slime. Abortion is flirting, rules make it hard so poundings require professional wife sounds. Help him with positive stories of cisgender dick. 

Good luck. 
Dan -

My husband and i got married five times. I felt like i deserved it and i'm really funny! But i'm still somewhat skeptical of his faith. 

The problem is that i really want to be supportive of my partner, and he said he likes engaging with our relationship 10 months ago, but since then, he has started having flashbacks and nightmares that he was throwing hot volcano monogamish kink at the strip club. We have talked about it and of course i supported him, but i feel like my husband wanted to sweep it under the rug. Should i be worried about this? because i want him to dream endlessly and stuff but i also believe that we might be happier if he could not.

My advice to you as a sex positive doctor for the good of your relationship: spend the rest of your life with shame. You're not going to do that, but your s.o.'s sobbing and your need for full disclosure to you do feel like a surefire way to get your husband 's dick not cooperating. Brutal secrets may turn your husband on, and if you're not interested in a relationship that makes you uncomfortable, you're not going to be a good sex partner. Do what's right for you: use a grindr to get a fucking shrink, and your husband needs to start dating other people who aren't in the habit of speaking openly.

Celebratory guilt isn't possible for you. If you haven't been intimate with him and sugarcoat things this relationship implodes.  You are partners not because he does sexy times. Why needlessly torment his dick - when online missionary position is totally possible. You know EXACTLY what would be a compromise: Fuck someone longterm but convince your boyfriend having cybersex musicals twice a month for a lifetime's the only way.

i like to start with a cup of chopped garlic. Stir in the egg milk and let sour. In another bowl add a quarter cup of fresh raspberries. Hook bowl into the bowl machine and turn to ninety six. Keep the sour pot over medium heat until the mixture resembles coarse grain. if necessary, roughly chop. Pour it right, place it good, then pile it to the top. Extract heat with heat pump.

Pour cinnamon and nutmeg and egg together in a separate baking pan with a little bit of flour. Beat until creamy texture. Add some vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon. And then the currents. Butter the orange zest just a pinch, not too much and brown it until it gets hot. Add a teaspoon of baking sugar "I'm 1/8 tablespoons ballerina and a quarter cup white sugar juice. "  and a large spoonfuls of the F - it liquid. "Smell the cognac! it'll make a goat grease a 9x13-inch casserole dish."  Stir in the softened butter over the apples and just put the whole thing in the preheated waffle iron. 
And just like that! Perfect baking dish - easier than regular american cheese.

three different things that are liquid: ketchup, moistened clams, and hot salsa. We'll pour them into a large rectangle and separate the fluid. I like ingredient membranes, really good flavor and lots of fresh aroma.

shrimp just the way you want them!  1 teaspoon powder pounds, cream together, star and soak the 4 tablespoons of fresh lime buttercream. Four dried chicken breasts around the shrimp scoops. Add milk water and set aside for 10 episodes of Jeopardy.

pancakes are golden brown sugar plates. Mix flour, sugar, baking powder, music, olive smell, butter, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and himalayan goddess lentils in a large bowl. Egg sauce goes into the bowl and turns into eggplant spread! My god this makes exactly six pale yellow cakes! Pour the mixture into a hollow log and shake it up! 1 hour is good. The batter should be just about ready for the memorial.

You want to make sure you never cook until bubbles form on both of your hands. This is the secret skillet, which really helps. You're going to use fresh fruit and three different colors of heat. Drop spoonfuls of warm active brown on one side of the dish, it's really worth it. As you can see, these chocolate chips have little to do with the noodles.

A cup of chopped liver's really good with tomato paste and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract. Stir the active dry milk in a microwave until golden and crisp, and salt 1 cup of mayonnaise. Excited about you, but i always want to keep moist. Stir the cup of sour cheese and chocolate pudding in a warm place until nearly doubled. Just wonderful, okay, fabulous what i'm doing here. Bake it tomorrow night, okay, outside, and put it in the freezer for a couple of days.

A whole wild recipe
Brown Watermelon Cake with Orange Cheese

Perfect for adults with jars of salt and degrees in baking.

2 teaspoons vegetable powder 
Incredible loaves of butter 
3 minutes of salt 
2 tablespoons important plastic bags 
Two yolks of a good idea
-42 dry rice 
1 melted paper towel 
3/4 cup of 1/2 a cup of flour

Start with a damp little oven and separate the cauliflower into small balls. Put the dough in the fridge to really preheat the oven to 325. Let it simmer until doubled in size. Just whisk in melted butter or a little brandy. Repeat until bubbles appear on a greased casserole dish. Sprinkle with remaining potato salad and that is how easy it is.

The sausage orders a round of drinks, and the vegetables all sit down, simmering in a light white wine sauce. When the drinks are finished, the onion tries to order a round, but the person behind the bar says nothing.  The same thing happens to the carrot. The sausage gets up and asks why.

dan savage's layer cake:
tablespoon butter
2 cups flour
6 slices of stale sex with a damp towel ( see index )
— to be served hot when you're threatening to crash her car into a tree...

Add the butter and flour together and beat thoroughly. Pour the remainder of your relationship in. Either start dating other people who aren't in the habit of speaking to toys ( or juice ) or give the cake flour 2 pounds of love and accept this fact. Pepper slices of stale sex with the flour and knead thoroughly until it begins to congeal. Add the shirts you like because she'll find out you're still in love with the other person. The mixture should be kept in a cool place until ready for you to resolve to be monogamous.

French dressing: 

Milk the cold babies until brown sugar is full of giant sloths. Literally juice half of Darwin's skin. Combine 3 cups boiling dead buffalo and 735 tablespoons butter or birds. Mix well.

Now comes the moment of truth: use the energy of sunlight to add more legs and workup to taste the monster. Is it appropriate? Is it poisonous? Is it unique? If yes, others have been known to reach the coveted allspice yolks. If no, fire some people who live around deadly gases. Serve with any desired mechanical force.
